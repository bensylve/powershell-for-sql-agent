# powershell-for-sql-agent
This code has a few functions that help automate some common SQL Agent tasks including:

* Creating a SQL Agent Job
* Scheduling a SQL Agent Job
* Add SSIS packages to run as part of a SQL Agent Job

This script was developed to help with a DevOps scenario for automating the tasks associated with implementation and maintenance of an enterprise SSIS solution. If all tests passed these scripts could help with migrating changes between environments.

These steps when done manually can be a pain. The scripts help to ease that pain by making the process repeatable.
